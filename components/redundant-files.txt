# Files that are no longer needed after refactoring:

1. None identified yet - our approach was to refactor existing files rather than create duplicates.

# Potential candidates for future refactoring/deletion:

1. If we build a standalone ModelGrid component, parts of predictions-grid.tsx could be removed.
2. If mobile components are fully integrated into their parent components using responsive design, mobile-controls.tsx and mobile-gallery.tsx might become redundant.
3. Password-lock.tsx could be made more secure by moving the authentication to the server side.

# Notes:
- We've successfully reduced code size by:
  - Moving duplicate code to shared hooks (use-model.tsx, use-predictions.tsx, etc.)
  - Creating reusable UI components (loading-indicator.tsx, glass-container.tsx, model-card.tsx)
  - Simplifying the model-viewer.tsx component by splitting it into smaller parts
  - Extracting utility functions to utils.ts

- The code is now more maintainable with:
  - Better type safety
  - Clearer separation of concerns
  - More consistent patterns
  - Centralized state management
